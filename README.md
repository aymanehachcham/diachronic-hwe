# Hierarchical Word Embeddings for Modeling Semantic Shift

![Diachronic Word Embeddings](images/bg-khawarizmi.png)

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and datasets for modeling semantic shifts in language using hierarchical word embeddings. Our approach leverages Poincaré Embeddings to capture the nuanced relationships between words over time, with a specific focus on the lexical changes as observed in the New York Times newspaper articles.

## Key Features
- **Hierarchical Word Embeddings:** Utilizing Poincaré Embeddings to represent words in a high-dimensional space.
- **Semantic Shift Analysis:** Techniques to track and analyze the change in meanings of words over time.
- **Dataset:** Extracted and processed data from New York Times newspapers, spanning multiple years.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

Work under development.
